               INT. BEDROOM OF 1950-ERA FAR ROCKAWAY HOME - DAY

               Camera is zoomed in on World War II memorabilia on a mantle,
               panning / zooming out to show a middle-aged man in a chair
               staring out a window.  A middle-aged woman with a Scottish
               accent walks into the room.

                         Mmmph.

                                   GERTRUDE OCHS
                         You haven't moved in over an hour.
                         Why don't you take a walk outside,
                         isn't that what the doctor
                         suggested?

                                   JACK OCHS
                         No!... Sorry dear, I'll be fine.

                                   GERTRUDE OCHS
                         Can I make you come tea? Or-

                                   JACK OCHS
                         No no, I just need to be left
                         alone, that's all.

                                   GERTRUDE OCHS
                         All right, dear.  I'm trying.

               Gertrude walks into living room, where two boys (ages 9 and
               12) are sitting on the floor playing a board game.  Gertrude
               pulls money out of her purse to give to the older boy.

                         Boys, why don't you go see a movie.
                             (hands money)
                         Here you go Philip, just be back by
                         dinner, okay dear?

                         All right, thanks Mom.



               EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY

               The two boys are walking together toward a theater.

                                   MICHAEL
                         You think they have anything new
                         this time?

                                   PHIL
                         Nah, this one never plays the new
                         stuff.

                                   MICHAEL
                         Ooh, maybe they'll have King Kong
                         again!

                                   PHIL
                         Forget it Michael, I'm tired of
                         that one.

               Boys walk up to theater, marquee reads "Red River starring
               John Wayne"

                                   MICHAEL
                         Not another John Wayne.

                                   PHIL
                         C'mon, this'll be great!  Let's do
                         it.

                                   MICHAEL
                         You think they're all great.



               INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY

               Phil and Michael sit in a nearly empty dark theater screening
               "Red River".  Phil looks mesmerized at the screen.  Cut to a
               closeup of John Wayne during his "1,000 miles to go" speech
               at 35 minutes in.  Cut back to Phil's face staring back.
               Play until the line: "there'll be no quittin' along the way,
               not by me, not by you."

        Act 1

        Ohio State 1959-61


        Journalist

        1959 student journalist, writing articles for The Lantern, they don't like his left-wing politics
        and coverage of the Cuban Revolution.  Phil starts his own paper



               INT. COLLEGE NEWSPAPER OFFICE - DAY

               Cut to Phil's face as a college student.

                                   EDITOR
                         Well?

                                   PHIL
                         Well what?  I can continue writing
                         for the Lantern, and keep putting
                         out my own newspaper.  I have
                         enough material for both.

                                   EDITOR
                         That's fine, but-

                                   PHIL
                         And I'm only doing this because
                         you're censoring me.

                                   EDITOR
                         Easy there.  As editor-in-chief, I
                         have to decide what will fit into
                         our papers, it's as simple as that.

                                   PHIL
                         And-

                                   EDITOR
                         And what you write isn't always fit
                         to print.

                                   PHIL
                         If you think my research-

                                   EDITOR
                         Come on Phil, it's not that.  It's
                         the editorializing.  It's the
                         blatant side taking.  Like this
                         last article you submitted on the
                         Cuban revolution.
                                                                  		4.

                         You're making Castro out to be the
                         good guy in some movie.

                                   PHIL
                         He is the good guy.  I mean, put
                         yourself in their shoes.  If your
                         whole life was spent-

                                   EDITOR
                         I'm not going to argue with you on
                         this.  You have to think about the
                         audience.

                                   PHIL
                         See, that's where you're wrong.  If
                         we just pander to the audience,
                         what service are we providing to
                         society?  We might as well not
                         exist.

                                   EDITOR
                         Without our funding, we won't
                         exist.  And what do you think will
                         happen to our funding if we keep-

                                   PHIL
                         Once I become editor-in-chief-

                                   EDITOR
                         If ... you become editor-in-chief,
                         and that's a big if.

                                   PHIL
                         We'll see about that.


        Hanging out with Jim Glover

        They met as roommates, Jim turned Phil onto folk music and political discussion with
        Jim's father



               INT. DINING ROOM IN 1950S HOME - NIGHT

               Phil, Jim Glover, and Jim's parents are dining at the dinner
               table.

                                   MR. GLOVER
                         Phil, I understand you've started
                         your own paper on campus, that
                         sounds like quite the undertaking.
                                                                  		5.


                                   PHIL
                         Word travels fast, Mr. Glover.  I
                         just have a lot more to write than
                         what can fit in the Lantern.
                         Thanks again for lending me those
                         history books, by the way.

                                   MR. GLOVER
                         Oh they're history books now, huh.
                         I guess I'm that old.

                                   PHIL
                         Oh no, I didn't mean-

                                   MR. GLOVER
                             (laughing)
                         It's all right.  Someday it'll be
                         your turn to be the old sage.  So
                         Jim says you're moving out of the
                         boarding house?

                                   PHIL
                         Yeah, I need to be closer to the
                         action, plus the other journalists
                         are mostly at Steeb Hall.  It won't
                         be as homey, but at least Jim's
                         records won't be strewn everywhere.

                                   JIM
                         Hey, you never complained!  I
                         thought you liked my records.

                                   PHIL
                         I'm just kidding around.  Now I
                         have to get my own copies of Woody
                         Guthrie.  And you'll have to get
                         your own copies of Elvis.

                                   JIM
                         Sure I will.



               INT. BOARDING HOUSE ROOM - NIGHT

               Jim and Phil is sitting on their respective beds.  Elvis and
               John Wayne posters are on the wall by Phil's bed.  Phil is
               eyeing an acoustic guitar that leans against the wall by
               Jim's bed.

                                   JIM
                         I still can't believe Kennedy's
                         gonna win the nomination.

                         I thought for sure that Humphrey
                         would get it.

                                   PHIL
                         Well, I called it, didn't I.  We
                         should've made it interesting.

                                   JIM
                         You know we still can.  He doesn't
                         stand a chance against Nixon in the
                         fall.  He's got no experience.

                                   PHIL
                         All right, you're on.  I'll put
                         fifty dollars on it.

                                   JIM
                         You don't even have fifty dollars.

                                   PHIL
                         I don't need it, 'cause Kennedy's
                         gonna win.  And when he does, I get
                         your guitar.

                                   JIM
                         Ok, you've got yourself a deal.

                         I don't know what to do.  Alice is
                         four months pregnant and she wants
                         me to marry her, but I don't think

                         Look, I was just talking to yer
                         yesterday.  She wants to have the
                         baby, but she won't do it without
                         being married.  I think you owe her
                         at least that much.

                                   PHIL
                         I don't know, I need more time to
                         think about it.

                                   SONNY
                         What's there to think about?  What
                         the hell's the big deal?  I mean,
                         it's not the rest of your life.
                         All you're doing is giving the baby
                         a legitimate name.  If it works
                         out, fine.  If it doesn't, so what?
                         You can always get divorced.  At
                         least she'll have the baby.
                                                                  		8.

                         You could at least do that much for
                         her.

                                   PHIL
                         Maybe divorce wasn't a big deal for
                         you, but that doesn't hold for
                         everyone... Sorry. Let me give it
                         some more thought, okay?



               INT. PHONE BOOTH AT HOTEL - NIGHT

               Phil is seated at the bed with a guitar in hand and a
               notebook at the desk, when the phone at the desk rings.  Phil
               picks up the phone.

                                   PHIL
                         Hello?

                                   SONNY
                         Hey, it's Sonny.

                                   PHIL
                         Hey, listen, if this is about Alice
                         again, I still need a week to-

                                   SONNY
                         You don't have a week to think
                         about it.  You have twenty-four
                         hours.

                                   PHIL
                         Why?

                                   SONNY
                         Phil, your father just dropped
                         dead.  They're bringing his body to
                         New York.  The funeral is tomorrow
                         and Ma's going to be there.  You
                         better decide what you're going to
                         do right now.

                                   PHIL
                         Why do I have to be there?  What's
                         the difference if I'm there or not?

                                   SONNY
                         Phil, this is your father.
                         Regardless of the feeling you have
                         or don't have, you must be at the
                         funeral, and it's tomorrow.
                                                                  		9.

                         So you get your ass out here, and
                         you make your decision by tomorrow,
                         because Ma's going to be here and
                         you're going to have to tell her.



               INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY

               Phil, Sonny, Gertrude, and Michael are in the limousine on
               the way to a cemetery to bury Jake Ochs.

                                   PHIL
                         Ma, I have something to tell you.

                                   GERTRUDE OCHS
                         What?

                                   PHIL
                         Alice and I are getting married.

                                   GERTRUDE OCHS
                         Why?

                                   PHIL
                         Because Alice is pregnant

                                   GERTRUDE OCHS
                         ...Why?

               Sonny shakes her head and starts to snicker.



               INT. PHIL AND ALICE'S APARTMENT IN NEW YORK - DAY

               Phil and Alice's apartment is a cluttered mess.  Phil is
               seated at the couch with his guitar and notes, strumming the
               chords to what will become "Power and the Glory".  Graham
               Green's book "The Power and the Glory" can be seen in the
               apartment.  Alice is holding her baby and hears a knock on
               the door.

                                   ALICE
                         They're here.

                                   PHIL
                         Will you get that?

               Alice sighs and walks to the front door while holding the
               baby, opening the door to let Sonny and Gertrude in.

                                   SONNY
                         Hi, we finally made it!
                             (to baby)
                         Hi Meegan!
                                                                 		10.


                                   ALICE
                         Phil, are you going to say hello to
                         your mother and sister?

                                   PHIL
                             (without looking up from
                              his guitar)
                         Hey.

                                   ALICE
                             (shakes her head to the
                              guests)
                         Please have a seat.  Can I get you
                         some coffee?

                                   GERTRUDE OCHS
                         That would be great, but here, let
                         me help.

               Gertrude holds the baby while Alice turns to the kitchen
               counter to pour coffees for the guests, who are taking seats
               at the kitchen table.  Phil continues to strum the same chord
               progression.  Sonny brings mugs of coffee to the table.

                                   SONNY
                         So, how are things?

                                   ALICE
                         Things are all right.  Lots of
                         gigs, as usual.  Phil's heading out
                         to Rhode Island next week, for this
                         big folk festival.

                                   PHIL
                             (without looking up)
                         Newport.

                                   ALICE
                         Glad you could join the
                         conversation.

                                   SONNY
                         All right Phil, what exactly are
                         you doing that's more important
                         than joining us?

                                   PHIL
                         I'm playing the greatest song I'll
                         ever write.

                                   SONNY
                         Well then, sing it.  What are the
                         words?
                                                                 		11.


                                   PHIL
                         I haven't written them yet.

               Alice rolls her eyes and shakes her head.


        Newport Folk Festival '63

        Feeling sick before gig (p 61-62), standing ovation.



               INT. INSIDE OF CAR - DAY

               Phil and other folk musicians are driving along I-95 from New
               York to the Newport Folk Festival in Rhode Island.  Phil is
               smiling while listening to his friends share stories about
               the previous year's festival.  Camera zooms into Phil's face
               as the sound around him gets muffled and his heart pounding
               is more visible.  Phil rubs his head as he feels a headache
               grow stronger, and he begins to perspire.

                                   FRIEND
                         Hey Phil, are you ok?

                                   PHIL
                         I'm not sure.  (grimacing) Argh, I
                         think I'm having a migraine.  I'd
                         better lie down for a bit.

               Phil lies down in the backseat, staring up at the ceiling and
               continuing to perspire.

                                   FRIEND
                         Feeling any better?

                                   PHIL
                         Not really... oh man, my heart's
                         racing, feels like I'm dying...

                                   FRIEND
                         Hey John, let's pull off when we
                         get to Milford, I'll bet there's a
                         hospital there.

                                   PHIL
                         No!  I can't miss the festival.
                         And I don't want you guys to miss
                         it either.

                                   FRIEND
                         Would you rather die instead?
                                                                 		12.


                                   PHIL
                         Maybe...



               INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - DAY

               Phil's friends are sitting in the waiting room, and Phil
               comes out of the back room.

                                   FRIEND
                         So what happened?  Are you feeling
                         better?

                                   PHIL
                         Yeah, the doctor gave me something
                         for the headaches, plus this
                         Valium.  But I'd rather not take
                         it.

                                   FRIEND
                         Well give it up then, man!  I could
                         use some later!



               EXT. FREEBODY PARK, NEWPORT FOLK FESTIVAL - DAY

               Phil is standing off stage with his guitar strapped on.  He's
               perspiring and taking deep breaths.

                                   PETE SEEGER
                         I don't want to deny the next
                         singer at least his two songs.  And
                         you'll wish when you heard 'em that
                         there's a lot more time for him
                         too.  It's Phil Ochs.

               Phil steps onto the stage and half-staggers to the
               microphone.

                                   PHIL
                         (mumbling)
                         Thank you.

               Phil looks out at the audience, which looks out of focus to
               him as the sound around is muffled.
                         Well I think whenever there's a
                         deep tragedy, there's also a
                         present, um, something of the
                         ridiculous, which is also true
                         about immigration, so um, I'm sure
                         you all remember a little town
                         called Birmingham.
                                                                 		13.

                         So I'd like to do you a song now,
                         called "Talking Birmingham Jam".

               He begins to play his guitar.

                                   PHIL
                         (in talking blues style)
                         Walking down to Birmingham...

               As Phil continues to sing, the sound becomes de-muffled and
               the audience responds positively.  He gets a standing
               ovation.

                                   PHIL
                         Thanks so much.

               Phil walks off stage and towards the nearby tree, where he
               slumps onto the ground, lays on his back panting and passes
               out.

                         Man, what a great show though.  So

                         let me play you that song I was
                         talking about.  This is the one
                         I've been trying to do for years.

                         again.

               Bob plays the initial chords again, but Phil reaches out his
               hand to interrupt.

                         again will change anything.  I'm
                         saying it's ok, but it's not going

               Bob Dylan is packing up his guitar while Phil gets up and
               they all head for the exit.



               EXT. SIDEWALK BY CARNEGIE HALL - NIGHT

               Phil, David and Bob Dylan are entering a limousine with their
               guitar cases.

                                   DAVID BLUE
                         Phil, I think once you hear it in a
                         rock format, it'll really come
                         together.  But I think it already
                         stands on its own-

                                   BOB
                         I'm done talking about it.

               The door shuts and the limousine begins driving away.



               INT. BACK LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

               Phil, David and Bob Dylan are silent in their seats, with
               their guitar cases in front of them.

                                   BOB
                         Actually you know what-
                             (motions to driver)
                         Hey!  Can you pull over for a
                         minute?

                                   DAVID BLUE
                         What's going on?

               Limousine slows down and pulls over.

                                   BOB
                             (points at Phil)
                         You're getting out.

                                   PHIL
                             (laughs)
                         You're kidding, right?
                                                                 		17.

                         Get out, Ochs.

               After a pause, Phil picks up his case and begins to exit the
               limo.

                                   PHIL
                         Fine.  You wanted my opinion so I
                         gave it to you, my mistake!



               EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT

               Phil exits limousine with guitar case.  Bob holds the door
               open after Phil exists.

                                   BOB
                         You're not a folk singer, you're a
                         journalist!

               Bob slams the door shut and the limousine drives away.

                         is our chemicals that scorch the
                         children, and our bombs that level
                         the villages.  We are all

                         I'm so glad you invited me.  Maybe
                         I should get a gig like this,

                         Hey, is it true that Bob Dylan
                         changed his name to boost his
                         career?

                                   PHIL
                         Sure is.  His real last name is
                         Zimmerman.

                                   RFK
                         Do you think it would help if I
                         changed mine?

               Phil and Jack Newfield laugh

                                   RFK
                         I understand you've spent a lot of
                         time on college grounds as part of
                         your touring.

                         I have.  In a way, it's like I
                         never dropped out.  I just started
                         playing instead of taking classes.

                         I'll bet you have a pretty good
                         understanding of the attitudes
                         around campus.  Now what we see in
                         all these student interviews
                         nowadays, would you say that's
                         reflective of the generation at
                         large?

                                   PHIL
                         I think I see where you're going
                         with this, after coming out against
                         the war today.

                                   RFK
                         Sure, that's part of it.

                                   PHIL
                         I think the students are paying
                        close attention to what you stand
                         for.  What I mean is it's not just
                         about the parties, but where you as
                         individuals stand regarding civil
                         rights and the war.  And I think
                         what do you did today was a good
                         first step.

                                   RFK
                         First step?  Sounds like I've got
                         my work cut out for me!

                         No, I understand.
                             (turns to Phil)
                         I've heard a few of your songs, you
                         know.  "Power and the Glory",
                         that's one of yours, isn't it?

                                   PHIL
                         Sure is!

                                   RFK
                         That's a very powerful song.

                         "Crucifixion"?  That's a great one.

                         That's fine, you can just sing it.

                                   PHIL
                         Fair enough.  All right.  Now, I
                         usually introduce these songs to
                         give some background, but I'll go
                         right into this one.

               Phil begins to lightly slap his leg to set the beat.
                                                                 		21.


                                   PHIL
                             (singing)
                         And the night comes again to the
                         circle studded sky / The stars
                         settle slowly, in loneliness they
                         lie / 'Till the universe explodes
                         as a falling star is raised /
                         Planets are paralyzed, mountains
                         are amazed / But they all glow
                         brighter from the brilliance of the
                         blaze / With the speed of insanity,
                         then he dies.

               RFK begins shaking his head slowly, tears begin to show

                                   PHIL
                             (singing)
                         In the green fields a turning, a
                         baby is born / His cries crease the
                         wind and mingle with the morn / An
                         assault upon the order, the
                         changing of the guard / Chosen for
                         a challenge that is hopelessly hard
                         / And the only single sound is the
                         sighing of the stars / But to the
                         silence and distance they are sworn
                             (singing)
                         Then his message gathers meaning
                         and it spreads across the land /
                         The rewarding of his pain is the
                         following of the man / But
                         ignorance is everywhere and people
                         have their way / Success is an
                         enemy to the losers of the day / In
                         the shadows of the churches, who
                         knows what they pray / For blood is
                         the language of the band.

               INT. COURTROOM - DAY

               Phil Ochs is sitting in the witness stand.  Judge Hoffman is
               seated as judge.  Mr Kunstler is cross-examining Phil Ochs,
               while Mr Foran the prosecutor is seated.  In the audience is
               Jerry Rubin wearing a headband, and Abbie Hoffman.  A jury is
               present.

                                   MR. KUNSTLER
                         Did there come a time, Mr. Ochs,
                         when you came to Chicago in 1968?

                                   PHIL
                         I came campaigning for Eugene
                         McCarthy on M-Day, which I believe
                         was August 15, at the Lindy Opera
                         House, I believe.

                                   MR. KUNSTLER
                         After you arrived in Chicago did
                         you have any discussion with Jerry?

                                   PHIL
                         Yes, I did.  We discussed the
                         nomination of a pig for President.
                                                                 		23.


                                   MR. KUNSTLER
                         Would you state what you said and
                         what Jerry said.

                                   PHIL
                         We discussed the details.  We
                         discussed going out to the
                         countryside around Chicago and
                         buying a pig from a farmer and
                         bringing him into the city for the
                         purposes of his nominating speech.

                                   MR. KUNSTLER
                         Did you have any role yourself in
                         that?

                                   PHIL
                         Yes, I helped select the pig, and I
                         paid for him.

                                   MR. KUNSTLER
                         Now, did you find a pig at once
                         when you went out?

                                   PHIL
                         No, it was very difficult.  We
                         stopped at several farms and asked
                         where the pigs were.

                                   MR. KUNSTLER
                         None of the farmers referred you to
                         the police station, did they?

                                   PHIL
                         No.

                                   MR. FORAN
                         Objection.

                                   JUDGE HOFFMAN
                         I sustain the objection.

                                   MR. KUNSTLER
                         Mr. Ochs, can you describe the pig
                         which was finally bought?

                                   MR. FORAN
                         Objection.

                                   JUDGE HOFFMAN
                         I sustain the objection.
                                                                 		24.


                                   MR. KUNSTLER
                         Would you state what, if anything,
                         happened to the pig?

                                   PHIL
                         The pig was arrested with seven
                         people.

               EXT. UNIVERSITY AUDITORIUM IN URUGUAY - DAY

               A crowd of Uruguayan students partially fill the outdoor
               auditorium.  A banner is hung from the stage honoring dead
               Tupamaro rebels.  David Ifshin is at the microphone on the
               stage, while Phil is standing offstage wearing his guitar on
               his back.

                                   DAVID
                         It really warms my heart to see
                         students on this continent fighting
                         for the same values as us in the
                         U.S.  As they say around here:
                         words divide us; action unites us.

               Applause from crowd.
                                                                 		25.

                         Now I'd like to introduce our next
                         guest, renowned singer-songwriter
                         and dedicated activist Phil Ochs!

               Applause and cheers from crowd as Phil steps to the
               microphone, hugs David.  David walks offstage and Phil
               positions his guitar.

                                   PHIL
                         Thanks David, and thank you all for
                         inviting us to your wonderful
                         rally.  You're probably not
                         familiar with most of my songs, but
                         I think you'll catch on rather
                         quickly.  This first one is about
                         compassion for your fellow man, a
                         song you may have heard sung by
                         miss Joan Baez.

                         Show me the prison, show me the
                         jail.

               Gunshots ring out from outside the auditorium.  A commotion
               begins to swell from the student audience.

                                   PHIL
                             (singing)
                         Show me the prisoner whose-

               Phil stops singing and looks out towards the source of
               gunshots.

                                   DAVID
                         Phil, get off the stage!

               Phil runs off stage and takes refuge behind a turned over
               table in the courtyard with David.  Soldiers are shooting
               from behind trees.  Tear gas is set off nearby as students
               return fire.

                                   PHIL
                         Wait til Rubin hears about this.
                         He'll be incredibly jealous that he
                         didn't come with me.

                                   STUDENT
                             (in Spanish to other
                              students)
                         Hold your fire!  Hold your fire!

                                   PHIL
                         What's going on now?  I can't tell
                         what they're saying.
                                                                 		26.


                                   DAVID
                         I think they're negotiating.

               Phil looks toward the university president's office, where
               Phil's belongings and some cigars are sitting at a desk.  The
               office is occupied by the rebel students.

                                   PHIL
                         I'm going to get a cigar.

                                   DAVID
                         Phil, you'll get killed if you go
                         out there.

                                   PHIL
                         A Cuban cigar is worth dying for.

               Phil runs across courtyard towards the office in a half-
               crouch with David close behind.  They get to the office and
               Phil grabs his belongings and cigars.

                                   PHIL
                         Comfort in the middle of anarchy.

               Students come out of hiding and more background conversation
               is present.

                                   STUDENT
                             (to Phil and David)
                         Ok, we came to an agreement with
                         the police.  You should be able to
                         leave now.

                                   PHIL
                         That's too bad, I was hoping to
                         finish my set.

                                   DAVID
                         That's not funny, Phil.

               Phil and David walk out of the office with the students and
               toward the perimeter of the campus where police are checking
               IDs.  Phil and David hand their passports to a policeman, who
               looks at the passports and shows them to another policeman.

                                   POLICEMAN 1
                             (in Spanish)
                         They're Americans.

                                   POLICEMAN 2
                             (in Spanish)
                         Don't be fooled.
                                                                 		27.

                         We had found Cubans using false
                         passports before.  Look at the
                         cigars.  Cuff them.

               Policeman 1 points a machine gun at Phil and David and
               motions them toward a police van.

                                   PHIL
                         Wait a minute, we're Americans!
                         Ask around, I'm a well-known singer
                         and I can prove it.  I've released
                         several albums, what are you doing?

                                   DAVID
                             (speaking over Phil)
                         Please, we are not Cubans, we're
                         Americans, we're guests of the
                         university.



               INT. CINDER BLOCK PRISON CELL - DAY

               Phil sits at bed inside locked cell. A nearby guard sits with
               a transistor radio playing generic rock.

                                   PHIL
                         Hey, it's bad enough to be in here,
                         but do you have to play that
                         horrible excuse for rock n' roll?

               Guard grimaces and increases the volume.

               David is escorted by guards into an adjacent cell, looking
               bruised.

                                   PHIL
                         What the hell happened?

                                   DAVID
                         Some rough interrogation
                         techniques.  So I talked with some
                         of the other prisoners last night,
                         some of them know English.
                         They're mostly here for political
                         reasons, and they've been here a
                         long time.

                                   PHIL
                         Oh god, don't tell me that.  But
                         they don't have American passports.
                         You'd think that would help us.
                                                                 		28.


                                   DAVID
                         It still might.  The guards keep
                         asking me the same questions, I
                         think they're finally realizing
                         we're not Cubans.  Sounds like
                         deporting us is on the table, as
                         long as it's not Bolivia.

                                   PHIL
                         What's wrong with Bolivia?

                                   DAVID
                         Apparently the prisoners who get
                         sent there have a bad habit of
                         disappearing without a trace.

               Two guards approach Phil's cell and open it up.

                                   GUARD
                         Come.

               Phil walks up and one guard handcuffs Phil while the other
               points his gun at Phil.  The guards do the same with David.

                                   GUARD
                         We are taking you to the airport,
                         where you fly to Bolivia.  From
                         there you go your own way.

               Phil and David look at each other with a terrified glance.



               INT. POLICE VAN - DAY

               Phil and David are in the back seat of a police van on its
               way to the airport.

                                   DAVID
                             (whispering)
                         We've got to have a plan, because
                         this could be it.  We can't go to
                         Bolivia.

                                   PHIL
                             (whispering)
                         Okay, here's what I'm thinking.
                         Once we get to the airport, I'll
                         create a diversion.  And you'll
                         sneak away and get us tickets to
                         Peru.  You still have your American
                         Express card?

               David holds up his handcuffed hands.
                                                                 		29.


                                   DAVID
                         And what do we do about this?  Once
                         they see the handcuffs they'll know
                         not to issue the tickets.

                                   PHIL
                         Just hide them in your sleeves,
                         you'll be fine.



               INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

               Phil, David, and two captors are walking near ticketing
               desks.  Phil stops and holds up his handcuffed hands to the
               passers by.

                                   PHIL
                         Help!  We're being kidnapped.
                         We're going to be killed by these
                         fascists.  Please.  We're innocent.

               Crowd around them starts paying attention to Phil and the
               captors.

                                   GUARD
                             (in Spanish)
                         Pay no attention to this man, he is
                         a dangerous criminal and an enemy
                         of the state.

               As guards turn their attention to Phil and the crowd, David
               slips off to a Braniff International ticket counter, places a
               credit card on the counter without revealing his handcuffs.

                                   DAVID
                         Buenos dias, when is your next
                         flight to Lima?

               One of the guards notices David is not present, looks around
               and spots him at the counter.  The guard runs to the counter.

                                   GUARD
                             (to Braniff worker in
                              Spanish)
                         Stop issuing that ticket.  This man
                         is in our custody.

                                   WORKER
                             (to David)
                         This man says you are under arrest.
                         You can't leave.
                                                                 		30.


                                   DAVID
                         Look, I'm an American citizen and
                         you're an American carrier.
                             (pounding on desk)
                         Just give me the goddamn tickets.

               David's handcuffs become visible from pounding on the desk.
               The worker looks at the handcuffs and shakes his head.

                                   WORKER
                             (motioning to guard)
                         I think you'd better go with him.

               Meanwhile, a member of the British Embassy is in the crowd
               and approaches the guard with Phil.

                                   EMBASSY OFFICIAL
                             (to guard)
                         If this man is an American you're
                         going to be in trouble for this.

               Official and guard discuss while David and the other guard
               return to Phil.  Embassy official turns to David.

                                   EMBASSY OFFICIAL
                             (to David)
                         Ok, the flight that you're on is
                         scheduled to go on to Lima after
                         landing in La Paz.  So you can
                         purchase tickets to continue there.

                                   DAVID
                             (to embassy official)
                         Thank you so much for your help.
                         No, really.



               INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - DAY

               David and Phil are seated next to each other in a plane mid-
               flight, without their handcuffs.

                                   PHIL
                         We did it!  Let's get some drinks.

               Pilot walks down aisle towards Phil and David.

                                   PILOT
                         What did you two guys do, kill
                         somebody?

                                   DAVID
                         Why?
                                                                 		31.


                                   PILOT
                         Well, this official came on before
                         we took off, and he wanted to make
                         sure you both deplane in Bolivia.
                         There are police waiting for you.

                                   PHIL
                         No, listen, we're not spies or
                         anything.  I was invited to perform
                         for students at the university.
                         But some of the students were
                         wanted by the police, that's all.
                         They're just paranoid, this is all
                         a misunderstanding.

                                   PILOT
                         Yeah, I've seen this before, this
                         kind of stuff happens.  All right,
                         when we land, just stay on board
                         and you'll be fine.  They can't
                         board an American carrier.

                                   PHIL
                         Thank you so much.



               EXT. AIRPORT LANDING STRIP - DAY

               Cut to plane landing in La Paz.  Armed jeeps drive up to
               plane.



               INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - DAY

               Phil and David look out window as the last of the passengers
               exit the plane.  Soldiers outside are inspecting passengers
               leaving the plane.  Phil and David slide down to be out of
               view from the window.

                                   PHIL
                             (whispering to himself)
                         We're gonna be fine, we're gonna be
                         fine, we're gonna be fine...

               Cut to passengers re-entering plane.

                                   PHIL
                         Was that it?  Are we safe?

                                   DAVID
                         I'm not celebrating until we're out
                         of the airport in Peru.

                         No, I'm not celebrating until we're
                         all the way back home.

        Travels in Africa, recording "Bwatue", mugged on beach (covert war book: p96)



               EXT. AIRPLANE TERMINAL IN NAIROBI - DAY

               Phil exists a plane and walks down the stairway, where David
               Ifshin awaits him.

                                   PHIL
                         We're going to have to control the
                         drinking.  You gotta help me stop
                         on this trip.  All I want is one
                         beer a day.

                                   DAVID
                         Wow, for you one beer a day is like
                         total abstinence.

                                   PHIL
                         Very funny.

                                   DAVID
                         So what's the plan once we get
                         settled in?

                                   PHIL
                         I don't know yet. I think I'll tour
                         around a little, but I want to take
                         it easy first.  Hopefully something
                         more relaxing than Uruguay.



               EXT. ROADSIDE FOOD STAND IN NAIROBI - DAY

               Phil and David are seated at the food stand enjoying a meal.
               David is eating grilled maize on the cob, while Phil is
               eating a Smokie Pasua (looks like a hotdog burrito).

                                   PHIL
                         Look at you eating all healthy.
                                                                 		33.


                                   DAVID
                         I'm still full from that big
                         breakfast.  What is that anyway, is
                         that a hot dog inside of that
                         thing?

                                   PHIL
                         It's called a "smokie pasua", it's
                         my new favorite.  They split the
                         hot dog and put in something like
                         pico de gallo, I think.  So this
                         morning I spoke with Jerry Moss at
                         A&M.  They're gonna set me up with
                         some studio time here.

                                   DAVID
                         Studio time?  I thought you were
                         taking it easy.

                                   PHIL
                         I was, I will.  But I'm loving all
                         the languages and dialects here, I
                         want to see if we can do some kind
                         of collaboration.

                                   DAVID
                         What, like you're going to put some
                         new arrangements to some of your
                         songs?

                                   PHIL
                         No, I mean new songs.  Something co-
                         written.  Like maybe I'll sing in a
                         mixture of English and Swahili.

                                   DAVID
                         You singing in Swahili, this I
                         gotta hear.

               David stands in the control while a local man is operating a
               modest mixer.  Through the window they can see Phil Ochs and
               local Kenyan musicians seated with various instruments,
               performing and singing "Niko Mchumba Ngobe" in Swahili.  Phil
               has a sheet of paper taped to a stand and is singing as well.

               EXT. BEACH IN DAR-ES-SALAAM - DAY

               Phil is walking on his own along a beach.  Three Tanzanian
               men are walking along in the opposite direction.  Phil smiles
               and nods at them as they pass each other.  Moments later,
               Phil is assaulted from behind.  The tallest of the men wraps
               his arm around Phil's neck and pulls him off his feet, while
               the other two men search Phil's pockets.  Phil struggles to
               breathe, and the man tightens his grip even more.  Phil drops
               to the ground and is beaten into unconsciousness.  The men
               flee with his cash.

               Phil is lying in a hospital bed with visible bruises on his
               face and neck.  Phil slowly awakes, with David Ifshin
               standing over him.

                                   DAVID
                         Phil, how do you feel?

                             (in a raspy voice)
                         What happened?  I thought I was on
                         the beach.

                                   DAVID
                         People found you lying there, it
                         looks like you were mugged.

                                   PHIL
                         Oh right, some people jumped me-
                             (lets out a painful cough)

                         The doctor said your vocal chords
                         had ruptured.  He thinks it will
                         heal for the most part.

                                   PHIL
                         For the most part?  What does that
                         mean?  This is my career-

                         Hey, try to relax.  You're gonna
                         need some time to heal.
                             (short pause)
                         Phil, there's something else.
                         There was a coup in Chile.
                         Allende's dead.

                                   PHIL
                         What?  Who did it, was it fascists?

                                   DAVID
                         Details are still coming out, but
                         that's what it looks like.  There's
                         more.



               EXT. ESTADIO CHILE (SANTIAGO) - DAY

               The stadium has been transformed into a makeshift
               concentration camp with political prisoners in the stands.
               Victor Jara stands in line on the stage with university
               professors and students, all bloodied with torn clothes,
               surrounded by soldiers.  One soldier who is surveying the
               prisoners stops at Victor.

                                   SOLDIER
                             (in Chilean Spanish)
                         You're that motherfucker son of a
                         bitch Victor Jara, singer of the
                         communist songs.  I'll teach you,
                         asshole, how to sing!

               Soldier pulls Victor out of the line and uses his rifle butt
               to strike Victor Jara in the back.  An air force officer with
               a cigarette in his mouth takes notice and strikes Victor in
               the back of his knees with his rifle butt, causing Victor to
               collapse to the ground.  They proceed to beat Victor.  The
               officer flicks his cigarette near Victor.

                                   OFFICER
                             (in Chilean Spanish)

                                   VICTOR
                             (in Chilean Spanish)
                         I don't smoke.

                                   OFFICER
                             (in Chilean Spanish)
                         I said smoke it, asshole!

               Victor reaches his trembling hands toward the cigarette. The
               officer smashes his hands with his rifle butt.  Victor pulls
               back in agony.

                                   OFFICER
                         Try playing the guitar now, with
                         your hands like that, you son of a
                         bitch.

                                   SOLDIER
                             (laughing)
                         Go ahead, sing us a song!  You're
                         on stage, your audience is waiting!

                                   VICTOR
                             (singing "Venceremos" in
                              Spanish)
                         A new world in the making, It's
                         there for the taking.  Santiago to
                         Rio.  The moment is waiting-

               The officer drives his rifle butt into Victor's mouth,
               knocking out teeth and splitting his lip.

                                   VICTOR
                             (continuing to sing)
                         The lost will be found, And named
                         out aloud.  Photos carried high.
                         The lives they've denied.

               The officer shoots Victor Jara in the head at point blank
               range and Victor collapses to the floor.

               INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - NIGHT

               Phil and David are flying back to New York.  David is trying
               to sleep and wearing an eye mask.  Phil is scribbling in his
               notebook.  David lifts his mask.

                                   DAVID
                         Aren't you going to sleep?

                                   PHIL
                         I can't.  Something's gotta be done
                         about this.  Listen, here's what
                         I've got so far.

                                   DAVID
                         Can't this wait til tomorrow?

                         No, it can't!  Listen, we're gonna
                         raise awareness.   We'll put
                         together a huge concert, set some
                         of the most popular entertainers in
                         the business.  And all the proceeds
                         will go to helping the people in
                         Chile.  We could record it and put
                         that out as a live album.  Like
                         what George Harrison did with
                         Bangladesh.  This could be huge.

               Deni Frand enters the restaurant and looks searchingly at the
               few customers present, attempting to pick out Phil Ochs
               without knowing what he looks like.  Phil is seated alone at
               a table and notices her looking around and stands up.

                                   PHIL
                         Are you Deni?

                         Arthur told me a lot about you, but
                         he should've given me a picture.
                         Hi.

               They shake hands.

                                   PHIL
                         He said a few things about you too!
                         I think what you've done with film
                         and organizing with be really
                         helpful here.  So he told you about
                         the concert.

                                   DENI
                         He did.  I didn't know a whole lot
                         about what happened in Chile, so
                         I've been reading through every
                         Newsweek and Time I can find.

                                   PHIL
                         All right, that's a good start.
                         And that's the thing, no one's
                         hearing much about this, and that's
                         what we're going to change.  So I'm
                         calling it "An Evening with
                         Salvador Allende" and I need your
                         help to run it.  I've already
                         spoken to Seeger and Guthrie, and
                         they're both in.  I'll keep at it
                         on that front and get more singers
                         on the bill.  Now I've also been in
                         touch with someone I'd met in Chile
                         before, his name is Claudio Benal,
                         he's a refugee living here, and he
                         still has connections back in
                         Chile.  He's interested in helping
                         out as well.

                                   DENI
                         Ok, that's great.  I know a very
                         accomplished organizer from the
                         Women's Strike for Peace, and I
                         think she'd be great for this team.

                         I didn't say we were.  I'm just
                         saying, as our promoter, we need to
                         win back his confidence.  What if
                         we pushed back the date to make it
                         work for Joan Baez, that would
                         definitely attract-

               END INTERCUT

               Phil hangs up the phone, takes down a valium with his beer,
               and steps out of the phone booth in the direction of Buffy.

                                   PHIL
                         Buffy!  Buffy!

               Buffy exits into a car before Phil can catch up.  Phil turns
               back toward the bar in defeat.  Then a familiar voice enters
               behind him.

                                   BOB
                         I know that voice.

               Phil turns around to see Bob Dylan approaching.  Bob is
               surprised at Phil's physical condition.

                                   BOB
                         What's happening, man?

                                   PHIL
                         Bob!  I'll tell you what's
                         happening.  I'm organizing a
                         concert for Chile.  I was here to
                         talk to Buffy about it, but I just
                         missed her.  Hey, remember that
                         song you wrote, where it said "It's
                         much cheaper down in South American
                         towns / Where the miners work
                         almost for nothing"?  Well how'd
                         you like to work for nothing and
                         sing that one song for this goddamn
                         rally?

                                   BOB
                         I'm not sure Phil.  I don't lend my
                         name out to a lot of causes these
                         days.  And I'm trying to keep a low
                         profile around here.

                                   PHIL
                         And that's why it would mean so
                         much more if you were there!  Look,
                         I'll give you four numbers.  If you
                         want to talk to me, you can reach
                         me at any of those four telephone
                         numbers.

               Phil scribbles down the telephone numbers on a napkin and
               hands it to Bob, who puts it in his pocket.

                                   PHIL
                         So what are you doing in town
                         anyway?

                                   BOB
                         Taking painting lessons.

                                   PHIL
                             (laughs then pauses)
                         You know, I can't really tell if
                         you're joking or not.

                                   BOB
                         Good!



               INT. PHIL'S APARTMENT ON PRINCE STREET - NIGHT

               Phil and Bob are in the kitchen, the table has a few empty
               bottle of beer.  Bob is seated while Phil is standing.

               MONTAGE: Phil brings Bob up to speed on the rise of Allende,
               Phil's meeting with Victor Jara in Chile, the military coup
               that followed.

                                   PHIL
                         ...so Allende became the first
                         democratically elected Marxist
                         leader, and you bet that scared a
                         lot of people...

               Phil reads Allende's inaugural address.
                         ...I stand here, members of the
                         National Congress, to urge you to
                         take up the task of reconstructing
                         the Chilean nation according to our
                         dreams, a Chile in which all
                         children begin life equally, with
                         equal medical care, education, and
                         nutrition. A Chile in which the
                         creative ability of each man and
                         woman is allowed to develop, not in
                         competition with others, but in
                         order to contribute to a better
                         life for all...

               Bob looks up at Phil, nodding.

                         I want to interview Train. Are you
                         Train?

                                   BRUCE MARTIN
                         What happened to Phil Ochs?

                                   PHIL
                         All right, brief recap.  On the
                         first day of summer 1975, Phil Ochs
                         was murdered in the Chelsea Hotel
                         by John Train, who is now speaking.
                         I killed Phil Ochs.  The reason I
                         killed him was he was some kind of
                         genius but he drank too much and
                         was becoming a boring old fart.
                         For the good of societies, public
                         and secret, he needed to be gotten
                         rid of.

                         before I go.

                         Yes, of course.  Why don't you come
                         up and stay here?

                                   PHIL
                         Thanks.

               EXT. LONG SHOT OF NEW ENGLAND HOME IN SPRING - DAY

               Sonny exits the home and enters a car, driving away.  A
               window is visible on the second floor with its curtains
               pulled open.  Its curtains close.
                                                                 		47.




               INT. VARIOUS ROOMS INSIDE HOME - DAY

               Cut to different corners of the house as we hear Phil's
               footsteps, the sounds of dragging a chair into the bathroom,
               the creaking of a door, a chair being stood on, a belt
               rustling, a door creaking shut, a slight chair wobble, the
               crash of the chair, then the quiet creaking of the belt
               against the door frame.

               Fade to black with the following text:

               "On April 9, 1976, Phil Ochs hung himself in his sister's
               home."

               Then show the following text below:

               "In 1982, Gordon Friesen and Sis Cunningham of Broadside
               Magazine used the Freedom of Information Act to request FBI
               records on Phil Ochs.  The FBI had kept nearly 500 pages of
               records on the singer, keeping close tabs on his whereabouts,
               informing other government agencies, sending agents to track
               him, and bugging his phone."

               "In addition to several albums, Phil Ochs left behind
               hundreds of written songs and lead sheets, most of which have
               never been recorded."
